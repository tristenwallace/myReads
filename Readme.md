# MyReads: A Book Lending App

MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows you to categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## Features

- Manage Books: Users can categorize books into three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.
- Search Functionality: A search page allows users to find books based on title or author and add them to their shelves.
- Dynamic Updates: Interactions on the page (e.g., changing a book's shelf) are handled optimally without page reloads.
- Routing: The app uses React Router for navigation between the main page and the search page.

## Technology Stack

- React: This project is bootstrapped with Create React App.
- React Router: For routing and navigation.
- BooksAPI: A backend API provided for interacting with preloaded book data.
